IsoWorlds is a large scale personal worlds manager originaly designed for Isolonice servers to increase and control performances. Instead of one big laggy world which needs protection, everyone get his own and can add/remove anyone to his whitelist. 
 Griefs / banned items decreases, possibilities are huge as you can set specific option for one or many worlds. 
 
 Each world is a copy of a patern so everyone can get the same world (preventing generation lag) and some modpack like In The Sea got their own generated map, so you can now offer thoses modpack to your community !

(Using Tick Dynamic for every IsoWorlds to set them with X% of ms could be done)
